//Add a document-ready event handler so that your script 
//will apply to the loaded DOM

//Inside that event callback,

  //Assign a click listener so that the radius of the circle
  //increases by 10% pixels every time it is clicked.
  //  HINT: see the `.attr()` method


  //Select all 'removable' elements, and for each assign a 
  //click event listener which removes the clicked element
  //  HINT: see the `.remove()` method
  //  EXTRA: have them animate away (either fadeOut or slideUp)


  //Add functionality so that the 'add' button adds an extra
  //"Remove me!" button. These buttons should appear ABOVE
  //the 'add' button
  //  CHALLENGE: make these new buttons also be removable!
  //             Reuse your functions so you don't duplicate
  //             code!
